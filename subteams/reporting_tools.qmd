# Overview

Although there is a wide variety of books and numerous journal articles written on Bayesian approaches in the analysis of data, not much has been written about reporting of these analyses, particularly as this pertains to clinical research. The goal of this subteam is to provide recommendations on good practices for Bayesian reporting and overview to selected software tools for Bayesian analysis.

# Overview

The BSWG Adaptive Design and Decision-Making Sub-team is focused on advancing clinical trial innovation and strategic decisionmaking across drug programs and portfolios. Our sub-team advocates practical feasibility and theoretical rigor in adaptive Bayesian methodology development and use. We build on posterior inference and quantify statistical errors that differ from classical metrics like type I error rate. Our work aims to facilitate more flexible, data-driven, and efficient decision-making.

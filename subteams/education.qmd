# Overview

The goal is to coordinate and provide Bayesian educational support which will help implement Bayesian approaches in drug development on a more regular basis as appropriate. We intend to provide education at a variety of levels, i.e., to meet the needs of statisticians and non-statisticians working in different organizations (e.g., industry and regulatory).

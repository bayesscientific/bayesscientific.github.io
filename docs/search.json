    "text": "Leader information\nOpen for lead and co-lead\n\n\nOverview\nSubstantial historical data may be available on the active-control and placebo before an active controlled trial is planned in a clinical development. Bayesian approaches provide a natural framework for synthesizing the historical data that can effectively be used in designing a non-inferiority clinical trial. Despite flurry of recent research activities in this area, there are still substantial gaps in recognition and acceptance of such application in clinical trial development."
